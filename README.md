# Charging-Sounds-Tasker
Plays a custom sound when the device is plugged into or unplugged from power. Sound files are configurable via profile variables.

* Import the profile by holding on the profiles section.
* Go to profile settings and pick the sound files that you want to be played under the Task Variables section.
(You can also use the sfx0.mp3 that i added to this repo, which i made with a bash script using SoX commands.)
